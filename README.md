# MLCLAS
MLCLAS is a Python implementation for various multi-label classification algorithms.

The project was built as part of my capstone project back in college so the code is quite outdated ðŸ˜….

## Dependencies
MLCLAS was tested to work with Python 3.5.

It should work as expected with the following dependencies:
- NumPy >= 1.10
- SciPy >= 0.17.0
- scikit-learn >= 0.17.0
- cvxpy >= 0.4.0


## Documentation
You may view the examples in the `examples` folder for reference.

If you are reading this from Pypi, please visit the Github page to download the `examples` folder.
